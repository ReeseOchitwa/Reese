                <p className='text-page paragraph'>I go to Bert Church High School. 
                                                    It is located in the south of Airdrie, about seven minutes from my house. 
                                                    I am in grade 10 and have been at BCHS for grade 9 as well. 
                                                    The school focuses heavily on its sport programs. 
                                                    We have so many sports team and they are always making more. 
                                                    We have football, basketball, volleyball, rugby, curling, golf, 
                                                    hockey, dance, badminton, soccer, and lacrosse teams. 
                                                    However, we do not have one tech or STEM club, which makes me sad. 
                                                    I have an older brother, who also attends BCHS. He is in grade 12 
                                                    and plays a lot of football. Right now he is signed to a team in Victoria,
                                                     BC to play Football after High School.

                <p className='text-page paragraph'>Bert Church has a lot of students. At the moment, we have 1200+, 
                                                    which is quite big, atleast for Airdrie. For reference Airdrie has 
                                                    about 70K residents. The school is kind of large and we recntly got 
                                                    portables, which I hate because it means I have to go outside during
                                                     -20 degrees to get to my class. Also, I have slipped and hurt myself
                                                      on the way over there. My shoes have zero grip.
                </p>
                <p className='text-page paragraph'>At my school, we are allowed to take three options during our 9 
                                                    and 10 years. Last year I took art, German, and guitar. 
                                                    I loved art. German was fun, but it was quite academic, 
                                                    we did lots of tests. I made a egg tree in the class though, 
                                                    it is still in my room to this day. I thought Guitar would be amazing 
                                                    because I just got a Guitar and didn't know how to play it. However, 
                                                    the class was entirely self-directed, so I had to teach myself the best I could.
                                                     Reflecting on my previous choices. This year I choose art again, culinary, and robotics. 
                                                     Culinary in my school is very fun. We tend the cafeteria and get to work in 
                                                     a commerical kitchen. During the selection process, I realized that the 
                                                     robotics class learned coding and computer science, so I took it as well. 
                                                     I am in robotics right now. I like learing the concepts. However, all the 
                                                     students are boys and I feel pretty out of place. Although, I did win the 
                                                     first design challenge.

                <p className='text-page paragraph'>I have so many options and class I want/need to take in grade 11 and 12.
                                                    There aren't enough periods in the year to take them. Because of this, I am taking summer school. 
                                                    Yay. I'm doing Chemistry 20. I want to take Computer science in University but I haven't settled on where yet. 
                                                    Im pretty good at school because I always try my best. However, I was extremely suprised when I 
                                                    got the award for the highest grades in the entire grade 9 student body last year. But now that I know 
                                                    the award exists, Im trying to do the same this year.
