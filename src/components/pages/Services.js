                <p className='text-page paragraph'>I love to draw and create artistic projects. Although I
                 don’t necessarily consider myself a creative person. I don’t know how easily creative ideas 
                 come to other people though. My artistic journey focuses more on the development of technique 
                 and taste. I began loving to draw in the fourth grade when I drew all of my teachers 
                 for an end of year gift. From there I began to excel in art class. I mostly drew cute 
                 cartoons that were inspired by kawaii tutorials on YouTube. A couple years later, I 
                 asked for and received a digital drawing tablet. This is when I really became serious
                  about art. Now, my art is hung up around my school and even featured in our theatre. 
                  Painting on my tablet is a relaxing and highly enjoyable pastime for me.

                <p className='text-page paragraph'>I got an acoustic guitar a couple years ago on Christmas. 
                I originally asked for one because I wanted to learn how to play an instrument. Playing one seemd impossible
                 because I didn’t grow up learning one. Ever since I have been 
                steadily getting better. I still think I'm not very good but I am definitely improving 
                and still find joy in playing the guitar.

                <p className='text-page paragraph'>In the fourth grade, my elementary school had 
                a girl's STEAM club. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had at school. 
                The teacher was extremely passionate about getting the girls engaged in tech and 
                design. I was even on a team that went to Calgary for a design challenge, and also went
                 to an event where I got to try coding with Scratch and Code.org. I revisited the 
                 concept of coding in Eighth grade very briefly. It was in grade nine when I decided
                  out of every job, being a software developer is probably the one I would enjoy the
                   most without getting burnt out. If I choose a job like art, I would probably end
                    up hating drawing because of the stress of work. I began with taking a couple easy online
                     courses in Html, Css, and Javascript. In grade 10, I took an online course with 
                     Schulich Ignite from U of C, where I learnt fundamental Python. Currently I am 
                     taking the advanced course, which uses PyGame. Im incredibly excited to be a part 
                     of ASIT and use my coding knowledge for a purpose.

                <p className='text-page paragraph'>To prepare for taking a German course at school, 
                I downloaded a language learning app on my phone. Today, I have a 590 day streak. 
                Even though I am not taking the course again, I keep on learning German because I 
                am interested in the difference in language. Learning new languages opens you up 
                to a whole new world of culture and communication. Last year, I began to learn 
                Arabic additionally. I chose Arabic because my mom’s family is from Lebanon and
                they speak the language, but never taught my mom. Doing language lessons 
                everyday is quite repetitive, however, I love learning the rules and differences in both languages.
