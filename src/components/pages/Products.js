                <p className='text-page paragraph'>I haven't been many places in my life. 
                                        For instance, I still haven't left North America yet. 
                                        During my childhood, I travelled around Alberta and Western BC, 
                                        places like Banff, Canmore, Medicine Hat, etc. 
                                        It is in this era I finally got to travel outside of western Alberta. 
                                        My family and I drove down to Idaho with another Hockey family. 
                                        We went on their boat and went tubing. 
                                        It was a fun and memorable experience; especially the 11 hour drive.
                </p>
                <p className='text-page paragraph'>My next journey was a family vacation to Cancun, 
                                                    Mexico for a week during holiday break. I had a great time drinking pina coladas. 
                                                    Such a great time we went back a couple years later to another resort. 
                                                    This one had golf carts, which made it very fun. 
                                                    I love going to Mexico because of the sun; I am always so cold here.
                </p>
                <p className='text-page paragraph'>Most recently, I went with my Mother on one of her work trips. 
                                                    She travels around the globe, teaching her craft. 
                                                    She has been to Lebanon, Dubai, Australia, Brazil, Germany, etc. 
                                                    This year she is travelling to nine more locations. 
                                                    For this trip, we went to Florida, Orlanda. It was an amazing trip. 
                                                    I worked as an media assistant. Staying at the resort was a dream 
                                                    and the experience was so unique and a constant adventure. 
                </p>
                <p className='text-page paragraph'>In the future I would like to travel much more. However, 
                                                    school and expensive prices make this kind of unattainable. 
                                                    However, I am currently trying to plan a trip to go to Portland, Oregon. 
                                                    My mother and I, would go at the end of July to see one of my favourite artists
                                                     on tour. They are playing in Vancouver too, but the venue is 19+.
                                                    My dream locations to visit would be somewhere in East or West Asia, 
                                                    and Hungary.
